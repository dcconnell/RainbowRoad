# RainbowRoad
Attempting to recreate rainbow road from mario with Three js

npm install parcel
npm install three
npm install -g webpack webpack-cli

Couple of weird things going here, since im not mega experienced
To get it to be on an actual website you have to run
webpack ./src/index.js

npm install -g webpack webpack-cli

if you're just running it locally, i didn't init the dev webpack server
so im using parcel which is pretty counterintuitive tbh
parcel index.html
